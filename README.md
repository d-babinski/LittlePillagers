# LittlePillagers

Little pillagers is a proof of concept game to present my approach to structuring the project, code and architecture for the sake of review.

I allow project and its content to be downloaded in order to provide analysis and review.

Please keep in mind this is a live codebase with real-life code with no sweeteners. 
Since it's a prototype it also lacks a lot in terms of optimization (most visibly no pooling was used) and I'll be happy to answer your questions in that regard on technical interview if necessary.
